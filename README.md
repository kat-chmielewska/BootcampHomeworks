# BootcampHomeworks

In this folder, you will find my first steps in programming, which are the homework assignments I completed as part of the frontend bootcamp at infoShare Academy. These are tiny little projects, I could say they were my first independent steps on the programming path.
The projects were mainly done using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
